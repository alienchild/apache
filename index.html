              <p><p>Named after the Apache Indians who used the path, the Apache Trail, or AZ 88 as it is formally known, connects Apache Junction at the edge of the Greater Phoenix with Theodore Roosevelt Lake, through the Superstition Mountains and the Tonto National Forest; 40 kilometers of steep, winding and mostly unpaved highway past splendid landscapes of twisted igneous hills with thick sagua trees. Past the lakes, the initial path continues in more traditional fashion to the former copper mining city of Globe (via Hwy 188), but it is the western part which is the most picturesque and well-known, however care is needed when riding and it is not suggested for big RVs or caravans; the biggest RV rental business in the US (Cruise America) does not enable their cars to be carried on this path.</p>
